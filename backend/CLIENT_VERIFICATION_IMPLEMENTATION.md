# Client Mobile Verification Implementation

## Overview
Mobile number verification has been successfully implemented for the Client Account Settings page, following the same pattern as the Service Provider profile verification.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Updated ClientProfile Controller
- **File**: `src/controllers/ClientProfile.controller.js`
- **New Functions**:
  - `sendClientOTP()` - Sends OTP via Twilio SMS to client's phone
  - `verifyClientOTP()` - Verifies the OTP entered by client
- **Updated Functions**:
  - `upsertClientProfile()` - Now requires phone verification before saving

### 2. Updated Client Routes
- **File**: `src/routes/clientProfile.routes.js`
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/client-routes/send-otp` - Send OTP to client's phone
  - `POST /api/v1/client-routes/verify-otp` - Verify OTP for client

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Updated ClientAccountSettings Component
- **File**: `src/pages/ClientAccountSettings.jsx`
- **New Features**:
  - OTP verification UI integrated with contact number field
  - "Send OTP" button appears next to contact number input
  - OTP input field with verify/resend options
  - Visual feedback for verification status
  - Submit button disabled until phone verification

### 2. User Experience Flow
1. **Enter Contact Number** → "Send OTP" button becomes available
2. **Click "Send OTP"** → OTP sent via SMS, input field appears
3. **Enter OTP** → "Verify" and "Resend" buttons available
4. **Successful Verification** → Green checkmark, form submission enabled
5. **Save Profile** → Only works after phone verification

## API Endpoints for Client

### Send OTP
```http
POST /api/v1/client-routes/send-otp
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "contactNumber": "+1234567890"
}
```

### Verify OTP
```http
POST /api/v1/client-routes/verify-otp
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "contactNumber": "+1234567890",
  "otp": "123456"
}
```

## Security Features

- **Same Security Model**: Uses identical security patterns as Service Provider verification
- **Temporary Storage**: OTPs stored in memory with 5-minute expiry
- **Verification Window**: 10-minute window to complete profile after verification
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Verification data cleaned up after successful profile save
- **Existing Profile Handling**: Existing clients with saved profiles are considered pre-verified

## Testing

### Test the complete flow:
1. **Login as Client** user
2. **Navigate to Account Settings** page
3. **Enter phone number** (use Twilio test number `+15005550006` for sandbox testing)
4. **Click "Send OTP"** and check for SMS/console logs
5. **Enter received OTP** and click "Verify"
6. **Fill remaining fields** and submit form

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ OTP sent via Twilio SMS
- ✅ Phone verification status displayed
- ✅ Form submission only works after verification
- ✅ Proper error handling for invalid/expired OTP
- ✅ Existing profiles work normally (pre-verified)

## Consistent Implementation

Both Service Provider and Client verification systems now use:
- **Same Twilio configuration** (shared environment variables)
- **Identical OTP generation** and validation logic
- **Consistent UI patterns** and user experience
- **Same security measures** and expiry timings
- **Unified error handling** and user feedback

This ensures a consistent experience across both user types while maintaining security and preventing fraudulent registrations.
